The war after [[Carthage and the 1st Punic War]] (ends in 241 BCE)

(Starts in 218 BCE)
# Truceless / Mercenary War
- Mercenaries of Hamilcar Barca are not paid for their work in the 1st War
	- They were pretty untouched by the war
	- Carthage has no money :(
		- Reparations
		- Cost of war
		- Disrupted trade
		- They impose a lot of taxes and no pay onto their colonies
			- They dont like this
- They besiege the city of Carthage along with the colonies that are not happy
- Carthage begs Hamilcar to defend so he does (takes 5 years total)

# Hamilcar's Invasion of Spain
- Hamilcar convinces Carthage to give him an army to expand southward into Africa
	- Carthage is in need of money and resources so they agree
- He takes the resources and bolts to Spain
	- Carthage doesn't really care because he's getting money I guess
	- He stays south because of Spain's silver mines
		- He makes his own money so he becomes independent enough to do more shit
- Hamilcar's family
	- Hannibal
	- Hasdrubal (2)
	- Mago
	- Daugher 1
		- Marries Hasdrubal (1)
	- Daughter 2
		- Has a kid named Hano
- Then he dies and Hannibal, Hamilcar's son takes over
	- Many interpretations of his death
		1. He lead the enemies away from his kids and died
			- Makes Hamilcar look good, written by his allies
		2. The leader of the Oretani tribe figures out how to immolate elephants, and one of them smushes him
			- Makes him look bad, written by Rome
	- He developed his Guerilla Warfare in Spain and **teaches it to his kids**
	- He made a blood pact with his father to **never be a friend to Rome**
		- This is important

# Hasdrubal 1 + Hannibal in Spain
- Hasdrubal, Hamilcar's SIL, takes over after Hamilcar
	- He is generally pretty cool
		- He sweet-talks all the tribes that were an issue in the past so they're on his side
	- He founds *Carthago Nova* or "New Carthage"
	- He establishes a **treaty with Rome** (bad idea) about borders and the Ebro River
 - Hannibal takes over after Hasdrubal is assassinated
 
  
# What Sets Off the War?
- That treaty causes conflict (wow)
	- The Ebro River is in 2 places, so Rome decides that the one they are talking about the one that gives them more land
	- Rome breaks the treaty and says "this is a city that is on our side of the river"
	- Hannibal says "bitch, no"
- Hannibal remembers the blood pact, gets angry, and besieges the city of Seguntum

# Battle of the Rhone Crossing
- 1 consul goes to Carthage, one goes against Hannibal
	- The latter is Scipio
	- Makes a deal with the Volcae
- Conflict at the river
	- Log Gauls defend 1 bank, sort of stalling
	- the Carthaginians cross as well
- Hano is sent for a secret attack and it works good
	- Guerilla warfare

# Battle of Trebbia River
-
