50 years after 2nd punic war (149 BC)

Carthage have paid off their reparations and can begin building their army and economy again

**Cato the Elder** (Roman Senator) makes a bunch of Anti-Carthage speeches
"Carthage must be destroyed"

**Numidia** (Rome's ally) starts to take over Carthage
Carthage fights back, breaking their treaty with Rome, and there is a big fight

Numidia wins the Battle of Oroscopa, Utica defects

Rome says "you broke the treaty bro", demands
- Send all weapons to Utica
	- They do that
- Abandon Carthage
	- **They refuse** (its a port city) (they wouldnt be able to make money)

Carthage settles in for 3 years of **SIEGE WARFARE**!!!!!! fun!

### Siege warfare
| defense pros                                 | defense cons                                  | attack pros              | attack cons                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| high ground                                  | limited supplies                              | access to resources      | more expensive in money and lives |
| tall walls that let you avoid head-on fights | sabotage and spies and purposeful bio-warfare | mobility                 | vulnerable to defenders           |
| terrain knowledge                            | siege weapons and artillery                   | access to reinforcements | wind up in your own siege         | 


Rome rolls up and builds trenches outside the city walls, and new wals
Rome sets up supply lines and camps outside the walls of Carthage

Name: **Scipio Aemilianus** (Scipio A. grandson)

Carthage build a whole bunch of fireships to wipe out a good portion of the Roman fleet

Scipio AE elected consul (only person whos done anything)

He builds a mole (water wall) to block off the Carthaginian harbor
It builds it taller than the city walls

### Examples of seige warfare
- Carthage fireships show avoiding head-on fights
- Carthage fireships (lack of resources) "suicide" ships
- Rome walls and trenches access to resources
- Scipio builds the mole showing access to reasources

## Battle of Port Carthage

Carthage dismantles their walls so that they can send ships out
Decreases defensive ability

Scipio brings his ships down to where Carthage is
The roman ships scare carthage and their ships get smacked into the walls (Scipio uses environment (learned from Hannibal))


## Battle of Nepherius
Carthage has a rickety rag-tag army still
Scipio takes his big army and encircles them (where have i seen that before)


Scipio returns to rome (winter)
Elected consul again despite being too young

In the spring Scipio returns with more men (access to reinforcements)

There is a quay (wow)
Scipio builds this quay so tall that his forces can step right off their boats onto the walls of Carthage
They ***Kill*** everybody in the city (woah)

## Moment of propoganda
either (Carthage story)
Scipio walks in and kills everyone
or (Roman story)
Scipio kills people for 6 days and offers to take prisoners and all the rich people burn themselves EXCEPT Hasdrubal III who turns himself in


They salt the fields (no one goes there for 200 years) and Augustus declares the area public land (go have fun)
## Carthage is GONE DEAD GONE FOR GOOD

The area that used to be Carthage is made a province of Rome and is ruled directly as Africanus Proconsularis

**Carthage is the last major power that Rome had to face. Victory over them shows Roman dominance. The entire mediterranean is now basically free for the taking**
