# Glossary
**Rotation** - Circular motion with the axis contained within the object
**Revolution** - Circular motion with the axis outside of the object
**Linear velocity** - Rate of motion in a straight line
**Angular Velocity** - Rate of motion in a circular arc
**Centripetal** - center-seeking

# Equations
The following is **always true**:
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$v = \frac{2\pi{r}}{T}$$
deriving:
$$a_c = \frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$
Where:
$a_c$ is centripetal acceleration
$v$ is linear velocity
$r$ is radius
$T$ is period of revolution
