How has media portrayal of Asian American evolved since the 1980s? How does *The Joy Luck Club* represent shifting representations in media of Asian Americans?

## The 80s
Essentially, it's bad. Media representation of Asian Americans was stereotypical and reductive.

## The 90s
Less overtly racist, but more enamored with the "exotic sexuality" of Asian women. Women did see some stronger roles, but only in comparison to the past. It still sucks. A common theme in many films was the appearance of Yakuza, a japanese gang, which reinforced stereotypes of Asians being untrustworthy and also skilled martial artists.

## The 00s
Asian Americans began to be represented more positively with many of the overtly racist stereotypes being dropped. For example, *Babel* is a movie where the main character is a deaf japanese girl, but the film does not unnecessarily tie parts of her character to her Asian heritage. The **white saviour** trope begins to appear, where non-white characters are often saved or necessarily helped by white characters, reinforcing weakness of non-whites.

## 10s
More subtle stereotypes evolve. The strict Asian mom stereotype pops up often in sitcoms.
