# Central Question
How can the representation of Asian Americans in 1980's cinema, which often included stereotypical and limited representation,

# Pre-1980s
Before the 1980s, Asian Americans were often portrayed by stereotypes. Asian Americans were a "Model Minority." Stereotypes set standards for Asian actors; for example, Asian American actors were often expected to know martial arts due in part to the success of Bruce Lee. Mr. Miyagi from *Karate Kid* portrays an old Asian man who is wise, knows karate, drinks tea, speaks in thick accent, grows bonsai trees, and is a mentory.

# 1980s
Some Asian-centric movies play into stereotypes, such as in *They Call Me Bruce*, which sets standards for Asian American men. Others, such as *Chan is Missing*, blur the line between fiction and documentary, and portray Asian Americans with a normal role in society.

# In *The Joy Luck Club*
- The book is written by an Asian American
- Established distinct identity between all characters
